BattlePunishments
=================
An all around minecraft player/admin management system that contains bans, mutes, IP tracking, watchlists, player help commands, and much, much more.

This plugin started out as a personal plugin for my server and has grown into a plugin full of amazing admin tools and cool features to help you run your server and handle player information. This plugin was released because I have experience in running large MineCraft communities and I could not imagine how difficult it would be to run them without these commands.
